## General description
The main goal of our application is to create a simple, easy to use mobile application for those who want to have a more efficient way to manage their time. 

I have multiple ideas for this project, all which I would love to have in an alarm app. There are several different applications for time management, but most of them are either too complicated or have too many features that are not needed. Most of them are also not free, which is a big problem for students.

Some of the features I would like to have in the application are:
- Alarm clock, which can be separated depending on the function (e.g. alarm clock for school, alarm clock for work, etc.,)
- To-do list
- Calendar
- Time table
- Daily planner

The application will be developed for Android devices, and it will be written in Java. The application will be developed using Android Studio. At least for now, the application will be developed for Android devices only, but if there is enough time, I would like to develop it for iOS devices as well. This is my first time developing an application for mobile devices, so a lot of things will be new to me. I have some experience in Java, but I have never used Android Studio before.
